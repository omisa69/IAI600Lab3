# IAI600Lab3
This repository contains the code, explanations, files, and final report for Lab 3: Fine-Tuning Machine Learning Regressors for Optimal Hyperparameter Selection, a part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course in the master's program (AI and Automation) at University West, Trollh√§ttan, Sweden. The lab focuses on fine-tuning regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) using Random Search and Grid Search with 5-fold cross-validation to determine the best hyperparameters for each model.
